Title: Workers are paying to get part of their paychecks early. It's 'payday lending on steroids,' one expert says
URL: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/28/why-one-expert-called-earned-wage-access-payday-lending-on-steroids.html
Summary: Earned wage access (EWA) programs allow low-income workers to access a portion of their paycheck early, potentially mitigating financial hardship between paydays.  While offering benefits like emergency fund access,  experts warn of potential downsides.  High fees can lead to interest rates as high as 400%, effectively turning EWA into "payday lending on steroids," especially with overuse.  The increased popularity of EWA, fueled by the pandemic and inflation, highlights a need for careful consideration of its potential costs and benefits for low-income individuals.

Title: How Earned Wage Access Can Upend Predatory Lending And Build Employee Financial Wellness
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christophermarquis/2021/02/05/how-earned-wage-access-can-upend-predatory-lending-and-build-employee-financial-wellness/?sh=766f0ed4e10c
Summary: Earned Wage Access (EWA) allows low-income workers to access their earned wages before payday, helping them avoid predatory payday loans with high interest rates.  This prevents them from falling into a cycle of debt and improves their financial well-being.  EWA is offered through apps like Payactiv, which integrate with employers' payroll systems.  The key is that it's access to *earned* wages, not an advance or loan, and the employer is a key part of the solution.  The CFPB has recognized EWA as distinct from credit, exempting it from federal lending laws.

Summary: This article focuses on the number of low-wage U.S. workers and doesn't discuss earned wage access (EWA).  Therefore, I cannot provide a summary addressing how EWA helps low-income workers' financial well-being based on this article.  The text primarily discusses the decrease in the number of workers earning less than $17/hour due to state minimum wage increases and changes to tipped minimum wages,  as well as the ongoing advocacy for a higher federal minimum wage.
